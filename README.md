# Algorithm Visualizer

The Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based tool that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides an interactive and educational platform to understand how sorting algorithms work by visually demonstrating the sorting process using animated bars representing numeric values.

### [Live Demo](https://thisiskhizar.github.io/algorithm-visualizer/)

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: The Algorithm Visualizer supports the following sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

- **Array Visualization**: Randomly generated numeric arrays are represented as vertical bars, where each bar represents a value in the array. The height and color of the bars change dynamically during the sorting process.

- **Randomize**: The tool provides a "Randomize" button that generates a new random array for sorting, allowing users to explore different scenarios.

## Usage
1. Upon opening the application in your web browser, you will see the Algorithm Visualizer interface.
2. Select one of the available sorting algorithms from the provided options: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, or Quick Sort.
3. Customize the array size and visualization speed using the input fields if desired.
4. Click the "Sort" button to initiate the sorting process.
5. Observe the bars representing the array values as they move and change color, demonstrating the sorting algorithm in action.
6. To generate a new random array, click the "Randomize" button.
7. Explore different sorting algorithms and observe how they perform in real-time.
8. Gain insights into the sorting process and algorithmic efficiency by visually analyzing the changes in bar heights and colors.
9. Enjoy learning and experimenting with different sorting algorithms using the Algorithm Visualizer!
